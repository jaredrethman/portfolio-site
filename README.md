# Readme for johnparrculver.com, My Portfolio Site

## Project Description
This site was built to share my story, projects, and ways to get in touch while demonstrating my current understanding of front-end software development.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this site, with media queries to provide a responsive design for mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop users.
Some challenges I encountered when working on this project were caused by creation of a full desktop experience first and then making the site responsive. There were also challenges with properly showing/hiding the mobile navigation menu.
In the future, I hope to add more projects, information about music-related pursuits, and new ways to make the website interactive and engaging.
